# Dungeons and Dragons Single-Player Game

## Overview

This project was given to us as a first year assignment in the course Principles of Object-Oriented Programming, written by [Idan Saltzman](https://github.com/idsa0) and [May Hadadi](https://github.com/mayhadadi).

This project is a single-player, multi-level version of a Dungeons and Dragons board game. The player is trapped in a dungeon filled with enemies and must fight through them to progress to the next level. The game adheres to Object-Oriented Programming principles and coding conventions.

## How to Use

The program takes a directory path as a command-line argument. The directory must contain files named `level<i>.txt`, where `<i>` is the level number.

Usage: `java -jar hw3.jar <Path to directory of files>`

## Game Description

The game is played on a 2D board represented by various symbols:
- `@`: Player
- `B`, `s`, `k`, `M`: Different types of enemies
- `.`: Free areas
- `#`: Walls

The game is played through a Command-Line Interface (CLI), and each level of the game is loaded from a file specified via command line arguments.

## Game Flow

1. The user chooses a player character from a list.
2. The game starts with the first level and progresses through multiple rounds called Game Ticks.
3. Each Game Tick consists of:
   - Player performing an action.
   - Each enemy performing an action.
4. The level ends when all enemies are defeated, and the next level is loaded.
5. The game ends when the player finishes all levels or dies.

## Player Classes

There are four types of player characters, each with a unique ability:

### Warrior
- **Special Ability**: Avengerâ€™s Shield - Hits a random enemy within range and heals the warrior.

### Mage
- **Special Ability**: Blizzard - Hits random enemies within range at the cost of mana.

### Rogue
- **Special Ability**: Fan of Knives - Hits all enemies around the rogue at the cost of energy.

### Hunter
- **Special Ability**: Arrow Storm - Hits a random enemy within range and reduces the enemy's defense.

## Combat System

Combat occurs when a player and an enemy occupy the same tile. The combat sequence involves attack and defense rolls, resulting in damage if the attack roll exceeds the defense roll. Players gain experience by defeating enemies.

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The game is controlled through the CLI with the following commands:
- `w`: Move up
- `s`: Move down
- `a`: Move left
- `d`: Move right
- `e`: Cast special ability
- `q`: Do nothing

The CLI displays the game state, including the board, player stats, combat information, and level-up notifications.
